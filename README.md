# Personal-Dmoj-Problem-Bank
Personal DMOJ Problem Bank is a Java application that allows users to store links to DMOJ problems they would like to solve, along with additional info.
It was created as a beginner friendly tool to help people learn programming through solving problems requiring various coding concepts.
These concepts will be used to categorize the problems, which the user can manually do so.


The program automatically retrieves and stores additional info once the user adds a new problem, making it easier for them to keep track of their tasks.
